# 🌴 App Academy Project 1 - *Let's Holiday Together*

Welcome to my first web development project for the FNB App Academy! This project was initially designed to help us grasp the **basic concepts of HTML**, but I chose to take it a step further by incorporating **internal CSS** and **JavaScript** to enhance its interactivity and visual appeal.

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Title**: *Let's Holiday Together*  
**Purpose**: A simple website for showcasing different holiday experience options—from cruises and yacht bookings to flights and cable car rides.

The site provides a fun, engaging way to simulate what a travel activity planning page could look like.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
